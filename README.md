# CoreLogic Studio - Tech Specs & Usage

## Overview
CoreLogic Studio is a next-generation Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) designed for professional and serious project studios. It combines a classic console-style workflow with adaptive AI assistance, integrated voice control, and tight hardware integration.

## Supported Platforms
- Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- macOS 13+ (Apple Silicon & Intel)

## Engine & Performance
- 64-bit floating point processing
- Latency below 10ms with compatible interfaces
- Multi-core processing and thread parallelism
- Plugin delay compensation

## Architecture
- Modular design: real-time core, UI, AI, and I/O separated
- Supports dynamic buffers, MIDI/MPE routing, and session management
- AI subsystem runs asynchronously with undo support
- Hardware abstraction layer
- Optional voice command control

## User Interface & Workflow
- Familiar layout similar to industry-standard DAWs
- Dockable panels: track list, timeline, mixer, plugin browser
- Themes: Vintage Heritage and Modern Dark
- Multitrack recording, editing, automation, and mixing

## Tracks, Routing & Mixer
- Track types: audio, MIDI, instrument, aux, VCA, master
- Unlimited bus routing, sidechains, pre/post sends
- Mixer with EQ, plugins, sends, meters, groupings

## Plugin Ecosystem
- Support for VST3 (Windows & macOS) & AU (macOS)
- Stock plugins: EQ, compressor, gate, saturation, delay, reverb, utility, meters
- Plugin quarantine for unstable plugins

## AI & LogicCore
- Modes: ON, SILENT, OFF
- Features: gain staging, routing recommendations, session health reports
- Performs analysis asynchronously with undo/redo

## Hardware & External Control
- MIDI, OSC, HID, and external I/O support
- Dedicated external gear control and insert control

## Development Phases
- Phase 1: Core DAW, routing, mixer, plugins, project management
- Phase 2: AI enhancements & macros
- Phase 3: Hardware mapping & voice interface
- Phase 4: Optimization, UI refinement, and public beta

## Usage
- Install and launch CoreLogic Studio
- Use top bar for transport, mode switching (ON/SILENT/OFF)
- Use sidebar for project management, plugin selection, templates
- Import media, record, automate, and mix
- Use voice commands if enabled

## Licensing & Updates
- Perpetual license: $250
- Rent-to-own: $25/month for 12 months
- 7-day trial: full features for 24 hours after purchase
- Update cycle includes AI and voice features within major releases
