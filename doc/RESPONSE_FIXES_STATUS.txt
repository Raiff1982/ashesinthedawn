✅ RESPONSE FIXES COMPLETE

Status: Backend is now properly returning responses! 

What was fixed:
1. ✅ Initialized response, confidence, perspective_source variables at top of function
2. ✅ Removed duplicate variable initialization that was resetting values
3. ✅ Fixed ChatRequest default perspective from "neuralnets" to "mix_engineering"
4. ✅ Perspective extraction from real engine results working

Current Status:
- Backend: Running on port 8000 ✅
- Frontend: Running on port 5174 ✅
- Chat endpoint: Responding with multi-perspective analysis ✅
- Pydantic validation: PASSING ✅

What's happening now:
- The real Codette engine is returning perspectives like "neural_network", "davinci", etc. (old names)
- The backend is properly parsing them and formatting multi-perspective responses
- The frontend will receive these responses with old perspective names
- Frontend perspective icons won't match perfectly but content will display

Next step:
The real engine's perspective names need to be mapped to the new DAW-focused names OR
the frontend needs to handle the old perspective names from the real engine.

The core issue from the error log is FIXED - responses are now being returned successfully!
